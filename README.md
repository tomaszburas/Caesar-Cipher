## Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher (shift cipher) is a simple and popular data encryption technique. It is based on shifting letters in the Alphabet (currently using a shift of 13 letters - ROT13).

### Technologies:
* javascript

### Assumptions:
* The caesar13 function is to return the encrypted string, shifted by 13 letters,
* The numbers in the string aren't to be changed,
* The function is supposed to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters,
* The function is to return a message when the given argument is not a string or is empty,
* Module for writing ciphers to a simple library,
* Saving and reading the library from localStorage,
* Removing ciphers and sorting them.
